how to build on windows:
1- make a build directory in the root directory, and a tests directory in the build directory:
mkdir build
cd build
mkdir tests

2- run cmake while in the build directory:
cmake --fresh -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..

3- run the generated makefile in the build directory:
make

4- enjoy!
